codeChan
========

An idea shamelessly stolen from codereddit.com, with an imageboard twist.

To start public Flask web server on port 9001:
    python codeChanServer.py

This doesn't comply with 4chan API guidelines yet; there is no method to stop the server from sucking down JSON on every client page refresh. So be nice.
